## What is it?

An easy-to-use stream-based toolkit that you can use for media processing. All the features provided have predictable
abstractions and join together coherently.

```js
// This example will demux and decode an Opus-containing OGG file, and then write it to a file.
const prism = require('prism-media');
const fs = require('fs');

fs.createReadStream('./audio.ogg')
  .pipe(new prism.opus.OggDemuxer())
  .pipe(new prism.opus.Decoder({ rate: 48000, channels: 2, frameSize: 960 }))
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./audio.pcm'));
```

The example above can work with either a native or pure JavaScript Opus decoder - you don't need to worry about changing
your code for whichever you install.

- FFmpeg support (either through npm modules or a normal installation) 
- Opus support (native or pure JavaScript)
- Demuxing for WebM/OGG files (no modules required!)
- Volume Altering (no modules required!)
